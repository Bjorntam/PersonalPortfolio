Bon Appétit is a tabletop roleplaying game where players take on the role of chefs navigating high-pressure kitchens and competitive culinary challenges.

As they progress from Novice to Master Chef, they unlock unique abilities and take on different kitchen roles, tackling intense scenarios from fine dining to street food battles. Success depends on skill, strategy, and performing under pressure.
