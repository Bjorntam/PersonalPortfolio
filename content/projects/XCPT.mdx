## Description
School Project | Group Development | Completed

**XCPT** is a simple yet intense **one-button** horror escape game that puts you in the shoes of a young urban explorer trapped inside a mysterious and terrifying mansion. After discovering the eerie black structure hidden deep within the forest, curiosity leads him inside, only for the door to slam shut behind him, locking him in. Now, with only a single button to control his actions, you must guide him through dark hallways, hidden passages, and spine-chilling encounters to help him find a way out.
- **Designed and developed in Unity:** UI prototyped in Figma with assets from Photoshop.
- **Role: Game Designer / Product Owner / Lead Programmer** – handled gameplay systems, story, and all programming.
